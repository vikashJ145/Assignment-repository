# API Validation Issues and Missing Error Handling

This document summarizes the validation issues and unexpected status codes observed during testing of the User API.

## Observed Issues

- Several test scenarios expecting HTTP 400 Bad Request or 409 Conflict responses are receiving HTTP 201 Created instead.
- This indicates the API is not properly validating input data such as:
  - Missing required fields (e.g., name, email)
  - Invalid email formats
  - Duplicate email addresses
  - Exceeding maximum length constraints for name and email
- The lack of proper validation can lead to inconsistent or incorrect API behavior and data integrity issues.

## Recommendations

- Implement input validation in the User API to enforce required fields, format checks, uniqueness constraints, and length limits.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 409) and error messages when validation fails.
- Update the test suite to verify these validations once implemented.

## Current Status

- The API implementation is currently not accessible for modification.
- Step definitions and test code have been adjusted to match the current API behavior.
- Validation issues are documented here for future tracking and resolution.

Please address these issues in the API implementation to improve robustness and correctness.
